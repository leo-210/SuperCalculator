# SuperCalculator

SuperCalculator is a CLI calculator app that can do various useful things :
  - Compute simple and more complicated calculations
  - Store values in custom variables
  - Solve equations
  - Determine the derivative of a function
  - And more...

Ultimately, I want to make this app not only a CLI app, but also a library to maybe
make a GUI for it.

One other goal is to not use any (or a very few) libraries, to learn new things and
build up an experience.


## Roadmap
  - [x] Math expression parser
  - [x] Computing calculations
  - [ ] Custom variable and constants (such as PI)
  - [ ] Math expression simplifier
  - [ ] Derivative of a function
  - [ ] Solve linear and quadratic equations
  - [ ] Solve certain integrals
